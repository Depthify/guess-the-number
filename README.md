# Guess the number!
> ⚠️ There's a bug while choosing a level, I'm working on a fix!

## How does it work?
In the game, your computer will choose a random number, and you will need to guess it correctly! If you fail, it will tell what your PC guessed. And of course, you can select levels!

## How to play?
`I` Download and install python from https://www.python.org/downloads/ (version 3.10 or above).

`II` Download the **random.py** file.

`III` Open command prompt (run > cmd) & move to the directory where the project file has been stored.

`IV` Run **__python random.py__** & follow the steps.

`V` You're good to go! :)
